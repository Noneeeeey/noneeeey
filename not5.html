<p><u><font color="red" font size="7">Dota is the one game that silmutaneously challenges me in many different ways at the same time. 
Dota requires planning, strategizing, team work, solo plays, item building, real time action, map awareness at all times, sharing of vital resources within the team, deciding what to prioritize in a given situation,
 reaction to opponents and a whole host of other things.</p></u>
